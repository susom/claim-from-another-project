# ClaimFromAnotherProject

When configured, each save in the source project will evaluate logic to determine if the source project should obtain
 a record from a second project.

 For example, a second project could contain an array of gift cards or key files.  When the source project is saved
 , we will pull a record from the destination project and save it to the source project.
